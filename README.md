# Working with Matthew

Hi! You're most likely reading this because you're working with me in some
capacity. Cool! I'm excited to see what we build together. :)

## Basics

- I prefer "Matthew" to "Matt".
- I use they/them pronouns. e.g. "Matthew just submitted their PR."
- I live in Edinburgh with my partner Dylan. Previously I spent 8 years living in Berlin.

## Working hours & communication

- I tend to start work around 9.30am UK time. I use that time to check emails
  & work out my todo-list. I also tend to do a lot of my written communication
  then.
- Long periods of focus-time are necessary for me to do my best work. I'm happy
  to attend meetings when necessary, but I'll also be honest if I feel like
  it's interfering with my, or my team's, work.
- I largely prefer asynchronous communication where possible, but I'm happy to
  have calls or face-to-face meetings when necessary.
- I'm happy to receive Slack messages or emails at any time, but I try not to
  check work chats on my personal devices outside of working hours. (Agreed
  on-call shifts being the obvious exception.)

## My interests

- Programming language design & UX. In particular right now I'm interested
in the ergonomics of dependent type systems, and the use of dependently typed
languages to aid in "theory building" as part of system design.
- Software development processes & organisation design
- Type theory (& foundational mathematics in general)
- Learning new things
- Stand-up comedy
- Really good filter coffee

## How do I like to give feedback?

- I like to give feedback when it's genuinely wanted. I'm not a big fan of
  overly-bureaucratic corporate feedback processes.
- I prefer to give written feedback, especially with a specific prompt. (e.g.
  "What do you think of my work on $PROJECT?") However, if the person receiving
  feedback prefers a face-to-face conversations, I'm happy to oblige. :)
- I like to provide quite detailed feedback on PRs. I try to make it clear which
  comments are required for approval vs which contain more general thoughts on
  the code & potential refactorings. If you're ever in doubt, please just ask.

## How do I like to receive feedback?

- I try to be open to feedback at any time, but even so it's best to ask & let
  me opt in to receiving it. (e.g. "Can I give you some feedback about that
  last retrospective meeting?") That way you can be sure you'll have my full
  attention.
- Please never message me saying something like "There's something we need to
  discuss. I've set up a call for later." I've been laid off before, and I will
  immediately assume it's happening again. (The caveat here being it's okay to
  do this if you are actually going to lay me off.)
